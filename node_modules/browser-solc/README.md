# browser-solc

## About the fork

Forked from https://github.com/ericxtang/browser-solc to wrap it into a npm package so that it can be easily imported into a Webpack (or another bundler) web app.

## Solc

Solc is the solidity compiler.  It usually runs on the Ethereum node.  Browser-solidity is an example for Solc in the browser, but it's hard to pick apart just the solc library from the entire application.  This repo is a wrapper that helps you do that.  browser-solc is a browserified version of [solc-js](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js).

## #[Demo app](https://s3.amazonaws.com/browser-solc.dappbench.com/index.html)

You should use browser-solc if you:
* Want to do `solc.compile()` in your Dapp
* Don't want to worry about browserify the solc-js npm package

## Installation

`npm install --save browser-solc`

## Usage:

```javascript
import browserSolc from 'browser-solc';
// After importing, the BrowserSolc will be loaded into the window object. This is required as it was built with browserify.

//Get a list of all possibile solc versions
BrowserSolc.getVersions(function(soljsonSources, soljsonReleases) {
  console.log(soljsonSources);
  console.log(soljsonReleases);
});

//Load a specific compiler version
BrowserSolc.loadVersion("soljson-v0.4.6+commit.2dabbdf0.js", function(compiler) {
  source = 'contract x { function g() {} }';
  optimize = 1;
  result = compiler.compile(source, optimize);
  console.log(result);
});
```


## Development
To build `index.js`, run `npm run build`.

Note: browser-solc does NOT implement the whole interface of solc-js.
